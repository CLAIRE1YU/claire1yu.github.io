**Wenshan Yu** is a versatile London-based composer specializing in film music, classical music, and electronic music. Currently studying at the prestigious Guildhall School of Music and Drama, Wenshan has a diverse portfolio and excels at translating a director’s intention.

Wenshan has composed music for 15 short films and has extensive experience in conducting and recording with session orchestras. As the composer for the animated short film *If I Raised My Mother*, Wenshan crafted the music that helped the film get shortlisted for the MullenLowe NOVA Awards, showcasing their talent and creativity in the industry.

In March 2025, Wenshan’s string quartet, inspired by Salvator Rosa’s *Witches at their Incantations*, was performed as the grand finale of a concert at The National Gallery. The piece showcased Wenshan’s ability to translate powerful visual art into an evocative musical narrative, highlighting a sophisticated interplay between imagery and sound. Additionally, Wenshan's classical piece, *The Ancient Market Place*, premiered at Wimbledon Community Orchestra’s Christmas Concert in 2022, receiving very good feedback from both the audience and the musicians.

Wenshan’s ability to support the narrative through the language of music makes them a valuable collaborator in any film or multimedia project.
