I am a London-based composer specializing in film music, classical music, and electronic music. Currently studying at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, I have composed music for 15 short films and am experienced in conducting and recording with session orchestras. A recent animation I composed for, *If I Raised My Mother*, has won the MullenLowe NOVA Award.

This is a recording session of a short piece The Little Red Horse.

My string quartet piece inspired by Constable's masterpiece, "The Hay Wain", was performed in The National Gallery.
