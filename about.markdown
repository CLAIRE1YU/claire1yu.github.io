I am a composer based in London, specialised in film music and classical music, currently studying at Guildhall School of Music and Drama. I have composed for 4 animations and have conducted and recorded with session orchestra. My recent classical piece The Ancient Market Place was premiered on Wimbledon Community Orchestra's Christmas concert.
